# this is a variation of Pej_Chrushit.sh, for cases that the file is far from sorted by the desired column, in which case Pej_Chrushit.sh gets very slow, this version sorts the file first and then crushes it. 
# This crushes a file by a given column:
# Chrushit Myfile 1 # crush myfile based on 1st column
# the closer to sorted the column is the faster this becomes.
# NOTE: This file assumes the first line is a header line!
